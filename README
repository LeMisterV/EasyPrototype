EasyPrototype is a minimal javascript framwork.

The only goal of this script is to bring some simple tools to javascript's prototype model.

Those tools are :

- easily create Class or ProtoClass (see ProtoClass definition after)
- automagicaly call some methods :
    - classSetup on Class creation
    - getInstance at the begining of object construction (return an object instance if the object has already been created)
    - init on object construction
    - destroy on window unload

- prototype inheritance
- parent prototype's method call (super)
- method callback (binding)


About ProtoClass :

What I call a ProtoClass is a Class created only to be inherited. It should probably be called abstract class....
